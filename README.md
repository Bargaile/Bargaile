- 👋 Hi, I’m Indrė (on GitHub a.k.a. @Bargaile),
- ✨ Learning is my KARMA.
- 👀 I’m a lawyer (according to the masters degree of Vilnius University), mom of three kids and a storyteller (from data) by heart. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science in Turing College. I just love numbers, math from the years in school and now I've found myself in Data Science. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for an opportunity to show, that no matter how old are you, what is your prefession, you can learn things that attracts you and do new things in a good way. It's never too late to learn something new. And you would be amazed, how much law and data science have in common.
